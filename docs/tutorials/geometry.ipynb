    "# Maps and orbital geometry\n",
    "It can be confusing to think about a map of a planet on an eccentric, inclined orbit at an arbitrary angle on the sky. Let's go through some examples that illustrate how `starry` handles 3D geometry in planet orbits. Note that this tutorial applies only to maps of `starry.Planet` instances. For maps instantiated straight up with `starry.Map`, there's no shenanigans: what you see is what you get!"
