    "# Enforcing non-negative maps\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest prior we can place on the surface map of a body is that its intensity not be negative anywhere. As we discuss in the paper, this is trivial to enforce for $l = 0$ and $l = 1$ maps, but can be tricky for higher degree maps since the problem is not analytic. Still, `starry` can efficiently determine whether a map is positive semi-definite (*PSD*) via the `map.is_physical()` method, which returns `True` if the map is physical (non-negative everywhere) and `False` otherwise (negative somewhere).\n",
    "\n",
    "To showcase this, let's investigate the values of the coefficients of maps of different degree that guarantee positive semi-definiteness. We'll run a very simple MCMC chain with a likelihood definied to be 1 if the map is *PSD* and 0 otherwise."
