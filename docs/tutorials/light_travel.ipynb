    "By default, `starry` does not compute the effects of light travel time. The main reason for this is that all the stuff in `starry` is unitless: the primary's physical properties (radius and luminosity) are fixed at unity, and the secondary's parameters are all specified relative to these quantities. In order to compute the light travel time within the system, `starry` needs to know the actual size of the orbits. Since all distances are measured relative to the primary's radius, to turn light travel effects on all you need to do is tell `starry` how big the primary is. This is done by setting the `r_m` (radius in meters) parameter of the `Primary` instance:"

    "Not bad! Note that they are in fact **slightly** different, for a rather subtle reason. There's actually no closed-form way to compute the light travel time delay at arbitrary points in the light curve! Let me clarify: it's (very) easy to compute what the delay `dt` is given knowledge of where the planet is in the orbit at time `t`. But that calculation tells me what the light curve will look like at time `t + dt`, when the information actually reaches the observer (well, technically, when it reaches the reference point). Our observations are at time `t`, not `t + dt`, so what we actually need to know is where the planet was in its orbit at time `t - dt`. This may sound easy, but if you think about it, we are essentially asking to know the position\n",

    "which is a transcendental equation! The difficulty boils down to the fact that $dt$ is a function of the planet's retarded position, so it's a function of the very variable whose value we seek. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get around this, what we do in `starry` is we Taylor expand the equation above to second order, so we get a pretty good approximation to $dt(x'(t))$. We then re-compute the orbital position at the retarded time and use that to compute light curves. So, long story short, the time delay computed by `starry` is not exact. In principle, we could take the expansion out to higher order. If you have an application that needs this extra accuracy, please let us know!"
